## Introduction 

I primarily work on puzzles hosted by Jane Street and IBM Research because I 
enjoy the mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking. I focus on
any problem using combinatorial optimization, problem modeling, or mathematical reasoning.
When I am not too busy, I do my best to solve every puzzle.
